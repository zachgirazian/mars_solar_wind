# A Search for Peculiar Plasma in the Atmosphere of Mars

At Mars, the solar wind - a continous flow of charged particles moving outward from the Sun - is usually deflected around the planet. In this project, I analyzed plasma data from NASA's MAVEN spacecraft to find outlier events that show unusual times when, instead of being deflected, the solar wind rams directly into Mars. I developed an algorithm to detect the outlier events, finding more than 20.

The Figure below shows measurements of charged particles in the atmosphere of Mars. They were made by NASA's MAVEN spacecraft as it flew through the outermost regions of Mars' atmosphere. The presence of Stripe 1 and Strip 2 are expected, but the presence of Stripe 3 indicates an unusual outlier event where solar wind has made its way deep into the atmosphere. These unexpected events help explain how Mars' atmosphere is impacted by the Sun and how it has changed over time.
