# A Search for Peculiar Plasma in the Atmosphere of Mars

At Mars, the solar wind - a continous flow of charged particles moving outward from the Sun - is usually deflected around the planet. In this project, I analyzed plasma data from NASA's MAVEN spacecraft to find outlier events that show unusual times when, instead of being deflected, the solar wind rams directly into Mars. 

The Figure below shows measurements of charged particles in the atmosphere of Mars. They were made by NASA's MAVEN spacecraft as it flew through the outermost regions of Mars' atmosphere.
